### Regular redux architecture extended with a layer of business logic.

It's a simple app written for demonstration purposes. All it does is a list of usernames. You can add and remove usernames.

I published an [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@dp.wireden/make-services-a-natural-prt-of-redux-architecture-8a78b6a4b961)
 that describes this architecture in details. I would be grateful if you got to read it sometime.
